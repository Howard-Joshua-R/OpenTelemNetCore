# OpenTelemNetCore
Simple .Net Core OpenTelemetry Implementation

## Usage

Very simple project to serve as my own person POC. Simply implements the Open Telemetry packages and exports the traces to the console.

## Issues

I'm not able to export traces to the DEBUG console but am able to export them to the default Console.
